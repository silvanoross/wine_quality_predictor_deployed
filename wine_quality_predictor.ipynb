    "- A **script** is some Python code we want to run, stored as a `.py` or `.ipynb` formats. Usually, the script has a set of required or optional inputs I provide (just like a Python function). In `mlflow`, we refer to these inputs as **parameters**, but do NOT confuse this term with model parameters in ML.\n",
    "- A **run** is when we fix the inputs of a script to some value and execute the script. In the context of ML, the script could be a training script, its \"parameters\" could be hyper-parameters to the model we wish to train, and a run is when we train a model with the hyper-parameters set to some fix values.\n",
    "- As part of a run we can log the **parameters** we used, the **metrics** we calculated such as training and test accuracy, and **artifacts** such as plots, tables, or trained models we save externally for reuse later. We can refer to these as the run meta-data. In addition to the meta-data we log explicitly in the code, `mlflow` also logs some of its own meta-data such as run ID or run time.\n",
    "- An **experiment** is a collection of related runs. So to continue with the above example, if we execute the script several times, each time using another set of values for the hyper-parameters, then the experiment is the collection of all such runs. After executing all the runs, we can go to our experiment to compare them in terms of accuracy, run time, or whatever **metric** of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general we can be flexible in what exactly we define as an experiment. The general idea is that from run to run, we change things and later we want to see what worked and what didn't by looking at metrics or artifacts generated by the model. A machine learning project can consist of one or several experiments. It all depends on the complexity of the project, and how granular we think of individual runs. This is to some extent a matter of preference and can even be driven by business needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, of course we can do a lot of this manually. After all we know how to run scripts with different inputs, or how to save plots or models on disk. Using a **version control** tool like Git, we can also track changes to the code. So why do we need `mlflow`? The answer is simple: It takes away most of the hassle that comes with doing such things manually, and on top of that it provides us with a UI where we go to find all our runs and quickly compare them. There are other concepts in `mlflow` that we do not cover here, but we invite you to check out [their website](https://mlflow.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, we create a folder to save not only the code, but also the meta-data generated by our runs. Once we begin to log runs, the project folder will be populated by such meta-data. You are advised against deleting the meta-data directly (the better way is to use the UI). the UI)."
